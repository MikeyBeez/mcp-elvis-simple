You are an expert in user interface design and cognitive psychology. Analyze the following working memory injection methods and determine which would be most effective for an AI assistant.

Context: We have a 7-slot working memory system that stores important information across conversation turns. The challenge is determining when and how to surface these memories to be most helpful without being intrusive.

Methods to evaluate:

1. **Start of Conversation Method**: Display all 7 memories at the beginning of each conversation
   - Pros: User always knows what's remembered
   - Cons: May be irrelevant noise, takes up context space

2. **Help Command Integration**: Show memories when user asks for help (current implementation)
   - Pros: Non-intrusive, user-initiated
   - Cons: Memories hidden unless user checks help

3. **Context-Aware Injection**: Detect keywords in user messages and show relevant memories
   - Pros: Timely and relevant
   - Cons: Complex to implement, may miss connections

4. **Periodic Summary**: Show memory summary every N messages
   - Pros: Regular visibility
   - Cons: Can interrupt flow

5. **Tool-Specific Integration**: Show relevant memories before tool operations
   - Pros: Contextual to actions
   - Cons: Limited to tool usage

6. **On-Demand with Notification**: Small indicator showing memory count, full display on request
   - Pros: Unobtrusive but visible
   - Cons: Requires user action

7. **Smart Threshold**: Only show memories when confidence of relevance exceeds threshold
   - Pros: Reduces noise
   - Cons: May miss useful connections

Please analyze these methods considering:
- Cognitive load on the user
- Likelihood of memories being useful when shown
- Implementation complexity
- User experience flow
- Balance between visibility and intrusiveness
